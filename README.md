## 👋 Introduction
Welcome to my personal cybersecurity knowledge base. This repository serves as a portfolio of my journey through **Penetration Testing**, **CTFs**, and **Vulnerability Research**. 

My goal is not just to capture flags, but to document the *methodology* and *thought process* behind each exploit.
